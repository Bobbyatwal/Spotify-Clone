# Spotify-Clone
Created a Spotify Clone Web Application with User Authentication using REACTJS [Functional Components & React Hooks], MATERIAL UI, REACT CONTEXT API, SPOTIFY API, AND FIREBASE HOSTING.

I have implemented API's from Spotify using React Context API for User Authentication and Rendering user data such as user name, user profile pictures, and songs / playlists dynamically. React Functional Components allowed for Re-usability, Efficient Readability, and Code Optimization for Fast Rendering. Material UI was utilized for every icon. CSS and Flexbox were used for Responsive Design, styling the Material UI, search bar, hover effects, smooth vertical scrolling, accurate color and sizing, and overall elegant theme.
